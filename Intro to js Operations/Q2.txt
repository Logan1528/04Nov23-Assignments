Q2. Describe the categorization of operators in JavaScript based on their functionality. Provide examples for
each category.

Assignment Operators
    
    Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. 

EX:
    const x = 5

    Here, the = operator is used to assign value 5 to variable x.

Arithmetic Operators

    Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic calculations. For example,

EX:

    const number = 3 + 5; // 8
    Here, the + operator is used to add two operands.

Comparison Operators
    
    Comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean value, either true or false. For example,

EX:

    const a = 3, b = 2;
    console.log(a > b); // true 
    Run Code
    Here, the comparison operator > is used to compare whether a is greater than b.

Logical Operators

    Logical operators perform logical operations and return a boolean value, either true or false. For example,

EX:

    const x = 5, y = 3;
    (x < 6) && (y < 5); // true
    Here, && is the logical operator AND. Since both x < 6 and y < 5 are true, the result is true.

Unary Operator

    Unary operators are operators that perform actions on a single operand. Letâ€™s explore some of the Unary
operators:

EX:
    const num = "21";
    conts rollNum = +num;
    console.log(rollNum);
