Q4. Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts
important?

Operator precedence

    Operator precedence determines how operators are parsed concerning each other. Operators with higher 
precedence become the operands of operators with lower precedence.

console.log(3 + 4 * 5); // 3 + 20
//  output: 23

console.log(4 * 3 ** 2); // 4 * 9
//  output: 36

let a;
let b;

console.log((a = b = 5));
// output: 5

Why is understanding these concepts important?

    understanding operator precedence and associativity rules is essential for writing correct and 
efficient code in JavaScript. These rules determine the order in which operators are evaluated in 
expressions, and they can greatly impact the result of complex expressions. By using parentheses 
and following the rules of operator precedence and associativity, you can write code that is easy 
to read and maintain.As the mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal once said, "Clarity of 
thought means clarity of expression." By understanding the rules of operator precedence and 
associativity, you can express your ideas clearly and effectively in code.
