Q1: Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development.

	JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement
 complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there 
and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates,
 interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can 
bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of 
standard web technologies.



JavaScript is widely used for building websites and web applications. Let’s 
discuss some practical applications of JavaScript in various segments.

1. Web Development
	
	JavaScript is a scripting language used to develop web pages. Developed in 
Netscape, JS allows developers to create a dynamic and interactive web page to 
interact with visitors and execute complex actions. It also enables users to load
 content into a document without reloading the entire page. Most websites use 
JavaScript for validation and to support external applications, including PDF 
documents, widgets, flash applications. Some of the world’s largest tech companies
 use JavaScript to better the user experience. 

	Some famous websites built by the use of JavaScript are Google, YouTube, 
Facebook, Wikipedia, Yahoo, Amazon, eBay, Twitter, and LinkedIn, to name a few. 

2. Web Applications

	Various JavaScript frameworks are used for developing and building robust 
web applications. In an application like Google Maps, if users want to explore a 
map, all they have to do is click and drag the mouse to get a detailed view. This
 is powered by JavaScript, which interacts with the browser without communicating
 with the servers. Popular JavaScript front-end frameworks that help build web 
apps are React Native, React, Angular and Vue. Netflix and PayPal were developed
 with AngularJS JavaScript framework and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). 

3. Presentations
	
	A very popular application of JavaScript is to create interactive presenta
tions as websites. The RevealJs and BespokeJs libraries can be used to generate 
web-based slide decks using HTML. The RevealJs helps create interactive slide decks
 with transitions styles, themes, and slide backgrounds in all CSS color formats. 
The BespokeJs is a feature-heavy framework that includes features like scaling, 
animated bullet lists, syntax highlighting, etc. Even if a user is not fully conversant
 with a programming language, they can easily build presentations as websites using 
JavaScript.

4. Server Applications
	
	JavaScript is also used to write server-side software through Node.js open-source
 runtime environment. Developers can write, test and debug code for fast and scalable 
network applications. JavaScript helps to generate content and manage HTTP requests. 
Top companies like Walmart, PayPal, Uber, GoDaddy, and many more have adopted Node.js
 for server infrastructure.

5. Games

	Creating games on the web is another important one among applications of JavaScript.
 The combination of JavaScript and HTML5 plays a major role in games development using JS. 
The EaselJS library provides rich graphics for games. HTML5 provides total access to the web
 without additional plugins like Flash. Complex browser games Tower Building, CrossCode, 
HexGL game are based on JavaScript and HTML5.
