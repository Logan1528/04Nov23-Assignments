Q6: Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript.
Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.

    Readability and Understandability Clear and meaningful variable names make your code more
readable and understandable. When someone, including yourself, reads the code later on, 
descriptive variable names make it easier to comprehend the purpose and intent of the variable.

Example:
    
    Meaningful identifiers in programming are crucial as they enhance the readability and 
maintainability of the code. For instance, consider a variable named `customerAge` instead
 of a vague `tempVar. CustomerAge` immediately conveys its purpose - it holds the age of a
customer.
