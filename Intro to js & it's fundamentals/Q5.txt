Q5:Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of single-line and
multi-line comments.

    JavaScript comments are used to explain the code to make it more readable. It can be used
to prevent the execution of a section of code if necessary. JavaScript comments are ignored 
while the compiler executes the code.

Single Line Comments

    A single-line comment in JavaScript is denoted by two forward slashes (//),
    
EX:
// A single line comment  
console.log("Hello World!");

O/p:
"Hello World!"

Multi-line Comments

    A multiline comment in JavaScript is a way to include comments that span multiple lines
in the source code.


EX:
/* It is multi line comment.  
It will not be displayed upon 
execution of this code */ 
 
console.log("Multiline comment in javascript");
